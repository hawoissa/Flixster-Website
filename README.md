### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt the topics, and more importantly code from the labs, helped me complete the assignments. The only topic I did not feel prepared to complete was the css option. Despite Lab 1, I still very much struggle with css but I understand it is up to me to learn more.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I did have more time, I would try to complete all stretch features especially the popup feature that will tell you more about the movie. I wanted to implement the movie-trailer button as well but could not find the url for each movie button. I will probably implement these features during this weekend when I'm free.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The HTML went well. The CSS did not go as planned, but thankfully the TAs, Rebecca and Snighda, were there to help me find the tiny mistakes which were making everything go wrong. The JavaScript was the hardest but Labs 2 and 3 helped tremoundously and so did Doug. My peers implemented their own personal touches to their websites to make it look personalized. I will do the same next time because my website is pretty basic.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

I'd like to give a shoutout to Doug who helped me tremoundously on this project and also on Lab 2 & 3. He got me to understand my code and the debuggin process. Wouldn't have finished this project without him. Thank you Doug!
